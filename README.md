# Coding Agent

This repository contains a coding agent that can clone a GitHub repository, plan and execute tasks, and interact with the user through a web interface. The agent is built with the E2B Python SDK and the frontend is a Next.js application.

***Note: This README file was automatically generated by an AI assistant.***

## Features

-   **Clone and work with any GitHub repository:** Simply provide a repository URL and the agent will clone it into a secure sandbox environment.
-   **Plan and execute complex tasks:** The agent can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps and execute them in order.
-   **Interactive web interface:** The frontend provides a real-time log of the agent's actions, including thoughts, tool calls, and command outputs.
-   **Support for multiple LLM providers:** The agent can be configured to use different large language models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
-   **Secure sandboxed environment:** All code is executed in a secure sandbox environment, preventing the agent from accessing sensitive information on your local machine.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main components: a backend Python application and a frontend Next.js web application.

### Backend

The backend is a FastAPI application that manages the agent's lifecycle and communication with the frontend. It consists of the following components:

-   **API:** The API exposes endpoints for creating sessions, running tasks, and streaming events to the frontend.
-   **Agent:** The agent is responsible for executing tasks and communicating with the LLM.
-   **LLMs:** The `llms` module provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM providers.
-   **Sandbox:** The `sandbox_handling` module manages the E2B sandbox environment, including cloning repositories and executing commands.
-   **Services:** The `services` module contains the business logic for running agent tasks.

### Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent. It consists of the following components:

-   **Agent Terminal:** The main component of the frontend, which displays the agent's activity in a terminal-like interface.
-   **API Client:** The frontend uses a simple API client to communicate with the backend.
-   **Real-time Updates:** The frontend uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to receive real-time updates from the backend.

## Getting Started

To run the coding agent, you'll need to have Docker and Node.js installed on your machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e2b-dev/coding-agent.git
```

**2. Set up environment variables:**

Before running the backend, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the `coding-agent-backend` directory. You can copy the example file as a starting point:

```bash
cp coding-agent-backend/.env.example coding-agent-backend/.env
```

Then, you'll need to fill in the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

-   `E2B_API_KEY`: Your E2B API key. You can get one from the [E2B website](https://e2b.dev/docs).
-   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key. This is required to use the LLM models.
-   `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token. This is used to clone private repositories and to push changes.
-   `GITHUB_EMAIL`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.
-   `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username.

**3. Start the backend:**

```bash
cd coding-agent/coding-agent-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

**4. Start the frontend:**

```bash
cd coding-agent/coding-agent-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**5. Open your browser:**

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start using the coding agent.

## How to use

1.  **Enter a GitHub repository URL:** The agent will clone the repository into a secure sandbox environment.
2.  **Describe the task:** Provide a clear and concise description of the task you want the agent to perform.
3.  **Select a model:** Choose a large language model from the list of available providers.
4.  **Start the task:** The agent will start executing the task and you'll see a real-time log of its actions.
5.  **Review the results:** Once the task is complete, you can review the results in the terminal.
