# System Prompt Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the coding agent's system prompt located in `coding-agent-backend/src/services/agent_runner.py`.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Detailed Tool Capabilities**
- **Previous**: No mention of available tools or their specific functions
- **Improved**: Comprehensive list of all 7 available tools with clear descriptions of their purposes
- **Benefit**: Agents now understand their full capability set and can make better decisions about tool usage

### 2. **Structured Operating Principles**
- **Previous**: Basic rules without clear methodology
- **Improved**: Systematic 5-step approach (explore → read → plan → implement → document)
- **Benefit**: Provides clear workflow that leads to more consistent and thorough task execution

### 3. **Enhanced Quality Guidelines**
- **Previous**: General mention of "valid and well-documented" solutions
- **Improved**: Specific guidance on code quality, project conventions, and best practices
- **Benefit**: Results in higher quality outputs that better integrate with existing codebases

### 4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- **Previous**: Basic "if you get stuck" guidance
- **Improved**: Systematic debugging approach with specific error categories and resolution strategies
- **Benefit**: Agents can handle failures more gracefully and provide better diagnostics

### 5. **Progressive Task Execution**
- **Previous**: Limited guidance on showing progress
- **Improved**: Explicit instructions to show reasoning, demonstrate incremental progress, and test changes
- **Benefit**: Users get better visibility into the agent's work and can intervene if needed

### 6. **Detailed Final Reporting**
- **Previous**: Basic task completion summary
- **Improved**: Structured summary format including accomplishments, key files, decisions, and future suggestions
- **Benefit**: Provides comprehensive handoff documentation for users

## Specific Improvements Made

### Tool Awareness
The new prompt explicitly lists and describes each tool:
- `observe_repo_structure` - for understanding project organization
- `read_file` - for analyzing existing code
- `write_file` - for creating/modifying files
- `delete_files` - for cleanup operations
- `run_bash_command` - for testing and git operations
- `commit_and_push` - for version control
- `finish_task` - for completion signaling

### Process Methodology
Introduces a systematic approach:
1. **Exploration Phase**: Understand the repository structure and context
2. **Analysis Phase**: Read documentation and existing code
3. **Planning Phase**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
4. **Implementation Phase**: Execute changes incrementally with testing
5. **Documentation Phase**: Commit changes and provide comprehensive summaries

### Safety Enhancements
- Stronger emphasis on avoiding infinite loops
- Clear guidance on handling long-running processes
- Systematic debugging methodology
- Better escalation paths when encountering unsolvable issues

### Professional Standards
- Emphasis on autonomous decision-making with documented assumptions
- Code quality and convention adherence
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Clear communication of trade-offs and decisions

## Expected Benefits

1. **Higher Success Rate**: Better tool utilization and systematic approach
2. **Improved Code Quality**: Clear standards and best practices guidance
3. **Better User Experience**: More informative progress updates and comprehensive summaries
4. **Reduced Failures**: Enhanced error handling and debugging methodology
5. **More Professional Results**: Structured approach with proper documentation and testing

## Backward Compatibility

The improved prompt maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality while enhancing the agent's capabilities and reliability. No breaking changes were introduced to the API or tool interfaces.
